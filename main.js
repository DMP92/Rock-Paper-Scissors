    - Once the user clicks their choice the computer 
    should randomly select as well
    - This should then cause a message to pop up with results
    - The game count should go to 5 and then declare a winner
    - After the game is over, there should be a message with a 
    prompt to play again
    - (BONUS) There should be a way to track the progress of 
    each game played in a session
